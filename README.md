Title: Global Structure Graph Mapping for Multimodal Change Detection
Authors: Te Han et al.
Content Description: This paper introduces a novel approach to Multimodal Change Detection (MCD) named Global Structure Graph Mapping (GSGM). The technique extracts 'comparable' structural features between multimodal datasets and constructs a Global Structure Graph (GSG) representing the structuralinformation of each multi-temporal image set, facilitating change detection among multimodal images.
